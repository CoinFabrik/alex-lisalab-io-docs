# LISA

Currently, LISA offers liquid staking for users looking to earn yield on:

For starters, we labeled LISA as Liquid Staking for All because our mission is to enable anyone from anywhere to easily convert their assets into safe and secure reward-generating assets.

If you have assets like Bitcoin, Stacks, or even USDT, LISA allows you to earn safe and secure yields by converting them into liquid staking tokens that you can further use on external DeFi platforms; in other words, tapping into more opportunities beyond the LISA yields!

We collaborate with highly trusted partners like ALEX, Ryder, Xverse, XLink, and COBO to make this possible!

### What Tokens does LISA Offers?&#x20;

LISA is deployed on and functioning within the Stacks blockchain network.&#x20;

Allowing users to free up their staked tokens by minting transferable utility tokens (known as Liquid Staking Tokens) that can be utilized in other on-chain activities.

Currently, LISA offers liquid staking for users looking to earn yield on:

* STX as LiSTX
* ALEX as LiALEX
* BTC as LiaBTC ([Coming soon](https://x.com/LisaLab_BTC/status/1846880393598747115)!)
* USDT (Coming soon!)

### Why LISA?  <a href="#id-460f" id="id-460f"></a>

* **Flexibility Unlocked:** LISA revolutionizes staking by offering the flexibility to earn yields without immobilized assets, keeping your capital fluid.
* **Dual-Token Advantage:** Users can choose between two token mechanisms:
  * **Rebasing:** Li-yield tokens offer a 1:1 conversion rate with your staked assets, ensuring your token count grows over time.
  * **Yield-Bearing Tokens:** vLi-yield tokens increase in intrinsic value as rewards accrue with each cycle, boosting your investment's growth potential—this is via the [Wrap Feature](features-how-tos/wrapping-unwrapping.md).
* **Maximized Efficiency:** LISA utilizes multiple staking pools, which allows for dynamic position adjustments, thereby optimizing investment efficiency.
* **Collaborative Strength:** By harnessing the collective expertise of leading Stacks developers, LISA provides access to varied staking strategies and enhances collateral use cases.
* **DeFi Expansion:** Through its integration with ALEX, LISA expands accessibility to DeFi services, solidifying its integral role within Bitcoin's decentralized finance ecosystem.

### Enter LISA

**Imagine this:** You've entered the realm of liquid staking, where you're not just earning rewards but also seeing your assets appreciate with a competitive annual percentage yield (APY).&#x20;

Staking has become one of the foundational yield sources across various blockchain ecosystems, not just Bitcoin, offering a smart approach to growing your portfolio. However, there's a traditional trade-off — your assets are typically locked up, inaccessible for other financial maneuvers for a set period.

As you survey the Bitcoin DeFi landscapes, rich with potential, you can't help but imagine what could be done with assets that are currently sidelined by staking commitments.

**Enter LISA —** a beacon in the liquid stacking space, designed to weave flexibility and dynamism into your investment tapestry. LISA elevates stacking & staking by freeing your assets by enabling participation in lucrative farming pools or using them as collateral for stablecoin loans, all while your assets continue to earn.

### LISA’s Distinct Advantage for LiSTX <a href="#a178" id="a178"></a>

LISA, a collaboration between [ALEX](https://alexlab.co/), [Ryder’s Fast Pool](https://www.ryder.id/), [XLink](https://app.xlink.network/) and [Xverse Pool](https://www.xverse.app/), leverages unparalleled engineering and operational excellence, setting a new standard within the Stacks ecosystem. Its key advantages include:

* **Enhanced Pool Integration and Flexibility**: LISA integrates multiple stacking pools like Fast Pool and Xverse Pool, boosting efficiency and diversification. This setup provides stackers with flexibility, allowing direct stacking above certain minimums or delegation below them. Unlike protocols that restrict users to a single pool, LISA offers a broad network of operators, enhancing effectiveness and using STX as collateral for other protocols.
* **Broadened DeFi Opportunities**: Through seamless integration with ALEX, Bitcoin’s premier finance layer, LISA significantly expands the range of DeFi services available to users, reinforcing its foundational role in Bitcoin’s DeFi landscape.
* **Innovative “Rebase” Tokens**: LISA introduces “rebase” tokens to Stacks, inspired by Lido’s success. These tokens dynamically adjust their supply to mirror their underlying assets’ value, facilitating efficient yield capitalization and flexible position management with minimal slippage. This breakthrough enhances LISA’s token liquidity and market stability, proving indispensable for DeFi users at every experience level.

## Maximize Your Stacking Efficiency with LISA <a href="#ddf0" id="ddf0"></a>

**Example with LiSTX;** The traditional stacking model often forces stackers to miss an entire cycle if they decide to adjust their locked STX, resulting in significant opportunity costs due to the two-week cycle.

LISA solves this by pooling STX from users and collaborating with various stacking pools, enabling a more efficient and flexible management system than individual stacking allows.

For stackers, this means greater freedom in managing your investments. With LISA, adjust your stacking positions without major opportunity costs, ensuring your STX is always working efficiently for you.

## Summary: A New Era of Stacking & Staking <a href="#id-53ef" id="id-53ef"></a>

LISA redefines liquid staking beyond the Stacks ecosystem by merging the expertise of our ecosystem partners to unlock unparalleled stacking and staking flexibility and liquidity.

By introducing dual tokens—both rebasing and yield-bearing—LISA enables participation in a broader DeFi landscape without sacrificing yield.

LISA not only enhances efficiency and diversification but also integrates seamlessly with ALEX, thereby expanding the DeFi opportunities available to users.

With LISA, stacking and staking are no longer rigid commitments but dynamic strategies, empowering stackers with the freedom to optimize their investments and navigate the evolving world of Bitcoin DeFi with confidence.

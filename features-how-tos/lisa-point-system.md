LISA points are points earned via holding eligible LISA tokens, different tokens represent different point earning ratio.

For example, 1,000 LiSTX earns you 1,000 points per day and each time you earn 2,000 points, you are rewarded with a LISA loot box.

You can also earn points by sharing your referral links to others; given if the referrer uses LISA via depositing STX or ALEX into LISA.&#x20;

The point leaderboard shows you both Points and also Volume; Points are the combination of both Volume (Deposited tokens) and also referral points.

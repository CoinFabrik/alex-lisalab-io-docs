#### To convert your rebasing token into a reward-bearing token, you can do this via the Wrap feature.

Wrapped LISA tokens will maintain the same amount but its intrinsic value changes each passing cycle.&#x20;

For example, your 1,000 vLiSTX will become 1,100 LiSTX after a year assuming the reward’s APY is 10% consistently while your rebasing version would just become 1,100 LiSTX reflected in your wallet.

To wrap:&#x20;

1. To wrap, you would need to have LiSTX balances within your wallet.&#x20;
2. To begin wrapping,  click on the [Wrap section](https://app.lisalab.io/li/stx/wrapUnwrap) of LISA.
3. Type in the amount you would like to wrap.
4. Check the rate of LiSTX -> vLiSTX; this only increases through time.&#x20;
5. Click ‘Wrap’ and approve the ‘Mint’ transaction.

To convert your wrapped token back to a rebasing token, you can do this via the Unwrap feature.

Unwrapped LISA token balance changes each passing cycle.

For example, your 1,000 LiSTX will become 1,100 LiSTX after a year assuming the reward’s APY s 10% consistently; you won’t need to click Unstack or check AMM rate to see your balance change as the LISA UI would reflect your balance change directly on the UI.



**To wrap:**&#x20;

1. To unwrap, you would need to have vLiSTX balances within your wallet.&#x20;
2. To begin unwrapping,  click on the [Wrap section](https://app.lisalab.io/li/stx/wrapUnwrap) of LISA and choose ‘Unwrap’.
3. Type in the amount you would like to unwrap.
4. Check the rate of vLiSTX -> LiSTX; you can also use this to determine how much reward you have earned thus far.&#x20;
5. Click ‘Unwrap’ and approve the ‘Burn’ transaction.

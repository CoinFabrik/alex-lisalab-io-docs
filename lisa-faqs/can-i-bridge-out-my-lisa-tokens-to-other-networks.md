# Can I bridge out my LISA Tokens to other networks?

Yes!&#x20;

Plus, for example, if you are holding vLiSTX on other networks, it will still accrue stacking rewards similar to those in the Stacks network.&#x20;

Additionally, you might even be eligible for bonus rewards, depending on the campaigns run by other networks.

The ALEX Explorer provides the most accurate representation of any amount of tokens swapped historically. This means you can see how much X you swapped for Y.

You can review both your personal transaction records and global transaction records, dating back to when ALEX was launched.

Currently, the ALEX Explorer supports interactions with both ALEX and LISA tokens.

Most importantly, the ALEX Explorer supports the rebasing mechanism! This feature is crucial because many wallets and explorers do not support rebasing, which can lead to inaccurate amounts being displayed on third-party user interfaces.

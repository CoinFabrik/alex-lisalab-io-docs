# How can I check the accurate LiSTX amount I’ve swapped via AMM?

To check how much LiSTX you have received via AMM swaps:

1. Connect your wallet on either LISA or ALEX.
2. Click ‘Explorer’ on the upper right of the LISA webpage.
3. Choose ‘LISA’.
4. Click on ‘My Records only’
5. You should be able to track back your swap history.&#x20;

Important to note, if you are using an external service to swap like Bitflow, it may not show up here.

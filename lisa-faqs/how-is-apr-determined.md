# How is APR determined?

APR are calculated based on the total number of stacking/staking cycles per year \* percentage of reward earned per cycle.

The $STX earnings are generated from the Stacks Chain stacking mechanism; your earnings will therefore vary from cycle to cycle.

Assuming the entire year's APY stays constant at 12% and you hold 25,000 $LiSTX for a year (26 Stacking Cycles).

* You started with 25,000 LiSTX
* After ONE stacking cycle, you will earn: 115.3825 LiSTX.
* The LiSTX balance in your wallet is then increased from 25,000 LiSTX to 25,115.3825 LiSTX
* You can keep checking after every cycle to see your updated $LiSTX balance.

Important to note that not all wallets or explorers support rebasing mechanism, which means that your LiSTX will not reflect accurately.

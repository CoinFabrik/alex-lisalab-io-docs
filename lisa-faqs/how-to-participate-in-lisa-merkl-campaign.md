# How to Participate in LISA Merkl Campaign?

To participate in the Merkl Campaign, here's what you need to do:&#x20;

1. If you have Stacks ($STX), convert them into $LiSTX either by [stacking](../features-how-tos/staking-stacking.md) or by [buying it via the AMM](https://app.alexlab.co/swap). Please note that stacking has a cooldown period; if you need $LiSTX more quickly, it is advisable to buy them through the AMM.
2. Once you have $LiSTX, use the [Wrap](../features-how-tos/wrapping-unwrapping.md) feature to convert it to vLiSTX, which is a yield-bearing version of $LiSTX.

3. Then, head to [XLink](https://app.xlink.network/bridge/cross-bridge) and connect your wallet that holds the vLiSTX.
4. Once connected to XLink, select:

* From: **Stacks Chain**&#x20;
* To: **Mode Network**

5. Enter the amount you want to bridge, scroll down in the Bridge UI, and check the approximate time and fees required for the bridge.
6. Once everything checks out, you may proceed to bridge over to the MODE Network.
7. Remember, you can always bridge back to the Stacks Network.

**Note:** This example uses the MODE Network as a reference.

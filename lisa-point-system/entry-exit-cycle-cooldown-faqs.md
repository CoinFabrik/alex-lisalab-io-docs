# Entry / Exit Cycle Cooldown FAQs

### Do I earn points during Stacking/Staking In?

Yes, you will start earning points if you have stacked or staked your supported tokens on LISA!

### Do I still earn points after Stacking/Staking Out?

No, you will no longer earn any LISA points once you have exited your current staking/stacking positions; this applies to both LiALEX and LiSTX.

### Do I earn points immediately after buying LISA tokens via AMM?

Yes, the moment you start holding LISA tokens, you will begin earning LISA points. Important to note that, your earning comes the next day, not instantly.&#x20;

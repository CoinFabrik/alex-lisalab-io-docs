# Point Reward Scores

### LiSTX

Every 1 LiSTX = 1 LISA Points per day

### LiALEX

Every 1 LiALEX = 1/20 LISA Points per day

Which is equivalent to 20 LiALEX = 1 LISA Points per day.

### Wrapped Token Points

You will still earn points if you are holding $vLiSTX on the Stacks network, the amount will be calculated based on the amount of $LiSTX amount from your current $vLiSTX holdings.&#x20;

Unfortunately, due to certain technical limitations, you will not earn points if you hold LISA-issued assets such as $LiSTX, $vLiSTX, $LiALEX, or $vLiALEX on networks other than the Stacks network.

Points are only available for holding these assets on the Stacks network.

### STX-LiSTX LP Farm via ALEX

You will receive LISA Points based on the amount of LiSTX you currently have in your STX-LiSTX pair.

For example, if your LP pair has 1,000 STX : 1,000 LiSTX within your LP pair; even though that would be equivalent to 2,000 STX since 1 LiSTX = 1 STX, you will earn 1,000 LISA Points since thereâ€™s only 1,000 LiSTX within the LP pair.

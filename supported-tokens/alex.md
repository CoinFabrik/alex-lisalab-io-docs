# ALEX ($ALEX)

LiALEX is a rebasing token of ALEX.

LiALEX replaces the legacy manual staking system previously offered by the ALEX AMM DEX. Instead of committing to a fixed number of cycles, holding LiALEX allows you to continuously earn staking rewards without the need to repeatedly re-enter your staking position after each cycle ends.

## 1 LiALEX = 1 ALEX <a href="#id-7d7f" id="id-7d7f"></a>

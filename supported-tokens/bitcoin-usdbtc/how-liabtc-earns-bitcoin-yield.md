# How LiaBTC Earns Bitcoin Yield?

LiaBTC earns yield by staking BTC on Babylon via the COBO API. The staked BTC is used to secure Proof of Stake (PoS) chains and generate yield.

The staked BTC supports the network's security budget, and stakers are rewarded with token emissions from the network that it secures.

It is important to note that LiaBTC yield accrues based on Bitcoin blocks, not on cycles like LiSTX or LiALEX.&#x20;

### How long does Withdrawal Takes?

Babylon has 7-day (\~1,008 blocks) unbonding wait upon request.

However, the withdrawal process would be similar to LiSTX withdrawal process.

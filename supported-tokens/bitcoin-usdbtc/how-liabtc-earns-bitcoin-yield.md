# How LiaBTC Earns Bitcoin Yield?

LiaBTC generates yield by staking BTC on the Babylon platform through the COBO API.&#x20;

The staked BTC contributes to securing Proof of Stake (PoS) chains, supporting the network's security budget. In return, stakers receive token emissions as rewards from the network they secure.

It is important to note that LiaBTC yield accrues based on Bitcoin blocks, not on cycles like LiSTX or LiALEX.&#x20;

### Withdrawal Timeline

* Babylon requires a 7-day (\~1,008 Bitcoin blocks) unbonding period after a withdrawal request.
* The withdrawal process follows a mechanism similar to the LiSTX withdrawal procedure.

# How would ALEX V2 Upgrade Affects LiaBTC?

With the ALEX V2 upgrades, XLink will integrate with LISA, allowing Bitcoin users to send BTC and receive vLiaBTC (in BRC-20) in their Bitcoin wallet (i.e., users won't need a Stacks wallet to interact with LISA).

This approach will also be applied to all other liquid staking products on LISA over time (in which case it will be STX/ALEX/USDT in BRC-20 => vLiSTX/vLiALEX/vLiUSDT in BRC-20).

Currently, LISA only supports staking in and out via the Stacks network, even though you can bridge the LSTs out of the Stacks network.

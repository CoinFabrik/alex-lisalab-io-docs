# What is LiaBTC backed by?

The underlying BTC backing aBTC is securely staked at Babylon, with COBO ensuring the finality of transactions, offering both security and irreversibility.

When users stake aBTC through LISA, they receive LiaBTC at a 1:1 ratio, directly reflecting their staked aBTC.&#x20;

LISA then works with XLink, the designated staking manager, to handle the staking of the Bitcoin that underpins those aBTC holdings.

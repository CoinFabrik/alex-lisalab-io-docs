# What is LiaBTC backed by?

The underlying BTC backing aBTC is securely staked at Babylon, with COBO ensuring the finality of transactions, offering both security and irreversibility.

When users stake aBTC through LISA, they receive LiaBTC at a 1:1 ratio, directly reflecting their staked aBTC. From there, LISA coordinates with XLink, the designated staking manager, to stake the Bitcoin backing those aBTCs.

# Stacks ($STX)

**LiSTX** uses a rebasing mechanism for balance growth, while **vLiSTX** appreciates in value as stacking rewards accumulate. This design ensures both liquidity and adaptability, maintaining LiSTX at a 1:1 ratio with STX, whereas vLiSTX’s value diverges over time due to rewards.

Locking STX grants users LiSTX, which grows in the balance to reflect stacking yields. LiSTX can be traded at any time: It can be redeemed for STX at face value or traded against STX and other assets on supporting exchanges.

Both LiSTX and vLiSTX adhere to the SIP-10 standard, yet they distinguish themselves in how rewards are accumulated. LiSTX rebases to increase balance, while vLiSTX’s balance remains constant as its value grows from stacking rewards. Users can interchange LiSTX and vLiSTX via a smart contract, ensuring sharing liquidity.

LiSTX’s rebasing keeps its value aligned with STX, enabling efficient trading with minimal slippage. In contrast, vLiSTX, expected to diverge in value from STX due to rewards, may experience higher slippage when traded.

### What are the differences between the STX tokens?

**$STX:**

* Can be used to participate in STX mining to earn BTC—e.g: via [Xverse](../../ecosystem-partners/xverse.md).
* Most CEX and DEXs use STX pairs for trading.
* Does not earn yield by itself, but you can add it to a liquidity pool (LP) to earn fees on a DEX like ALEX.

**$LiSTX:**

* Earns up to \~10% in STX yield rewards annually.
* Your LiSTX balance increases with each stacking cycle via a rebasing mechanism.
* Requires you to unstake back to STX for CEX deposits.

**$vLiSTX:**

* Its intrinsic value increases as rewards accrue with each cycle, but your balance remains the same.
* Requires you to wrap it from LiSTX; which you can also unwrap via the [Unwrap](../../features-how-tos/wrapping-unwrapping.md) feature.
* Bridgeable to other networks via XLink (Allows you to participate in different network campaigns).

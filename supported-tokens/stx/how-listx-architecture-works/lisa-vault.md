# LISA Vault

## LISA Vault

LISA Vault holds STX that are received from the LISA users and that are available for LiSTX redemption.

LISA Vault permissions Strategies to pull STX from itself to be deployed to the members of the Strategies. In return, Strategies are implemented so that they can send STX only to LISA Vault.

# Strategies

## Strategies

Strategies are the smart contracts that implement particular stacking strategies. Each strategy may have one or more "members" which join and delegate STX to different stacking pools.&#x20;

They are managed by Strategy Managers, who decide the allocation of STX across the members of its strategy for each cycle.
